# SearchTube

I wanted to create something that would help people find stand-up shows in their area. 
I used javascript and used the ticketmaster api for the ticket info. 


Feedback from users: 
- Change font style
- ~~Give more generic about app~~
- ~~submit button needs to be more modern~~
- ~~change cursor to pointer~~ 
- make related comedians clickable (url)
- ~~replace  searching text with with loading circle~~  
- add alert message if no results found 
- ~~have a map information under city search bar~~ 
- If related comedians clicked add them to the top(remove from comedianpool)and then call render(render will handle the dirty work)
- ~~Change background to a image instead of a video~~
